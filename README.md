Here should be some description in future.

#### Notes

Within this repository, **L** is a synonym of **g**erm-line **r**estricted **c**hromosome (**GRC**).

### Important places to look at

  - Google drive "Sciara_L_chromosome" (written documents; you should have access if you are supposed to have an access)
  - [Code](https://github.com/RossLab/Sciara-L-chromosome/blob/master/scripts/kmer-assigment-of-L-X-A/L-assignment.R#L28-L30) that **decides about assigments** what is L / Lc / Lk / Lp / AX / AXp (we can latter one separate A and X using either male coverage or the reference genome). In total the assigment fractions now are (Mbp):

  |    L    |    Lc    |    A    |    Ac    |    X    |    Xc    |    NA    |
  | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
  | 154.1   |  6.8     |  162.4  |  9       |  52.9   |  2.4     |  10.1    |
